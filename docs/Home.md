# #Nose

## Project Description
Just like Python-Nose test discovery tool for .NET:
Automating unit test run in a specific directory using simple command line tool.

## How to Use
Using #Nose is as simple as running SharpNose.exe from the command line - in fact this is all it takes:
* Run all unit tests in that directory: **SharpNose.exe _directory_**
* Configure application: from the application's settings
